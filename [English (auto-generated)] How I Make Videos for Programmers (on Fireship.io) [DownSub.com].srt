00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,399
hey what's up everybody my name is jeff

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,240
and i make programming tutorials over at

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,279
fireship io

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,279
and something people often ask me is how

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,480
do i make my videos

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,080
so today i'll show you everything i've

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,599
learned over the last few years about

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,040
building high quality programming

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,160
content for youtube

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,640
i started my channel in 2017 without any

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
video production skills

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,600
and it's grown to over 400 000

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,520
subscribers and a full-time income

14
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,800
over the next few minutes you'll learn

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
about the tools i use my workflow

16
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,160
and just generally how i approach

17
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,000
content creation the best time to start

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a youtube channel was 15 years ago the

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,960
second best time

20
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,440
is right now video content ages quickly

21
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,880
and that means there's almost endless

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,800
possibilities for creators to build a

23
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,320
business on this platform but if you're

24
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,920
sitting there with zero subscribers

25
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,600
it might seem like an impossible goal

26
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
how do you start with absolutely no

27
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
social following and build a big youtube

28
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,200
channel

29
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,039
it's actually really simple just focus

30
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,480
on creating high quality content

31
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,360
consistently

32
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
and try to make each new video better

33
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,879
than the last what happens is you start

34
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,559
building this positive feedback loop and

35
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,320
it grows bigger and bigger over time

36
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
use other creators as inspiration but

37
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,680
really try to embrace your own unique

38
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,640
voice and style

39
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,239
when you find that voice things become

40
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,680
easy you don't need to be anything

41
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
special i'm just an introverted nobody

42
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
what you do need to have is passion for

43
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,439
what you do and on a deeper level than

44
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,040
just money or internet fame

45
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
if you don't have that passion right now

46
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,840
you'll never stick it out and you'll

47
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,200
never be happy doing it

48
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,720
but if you do have that passion then

49
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,400
you'll first need some hardware

50
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
you don't need anything expensive or

51
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,520
fancy it's 99

52
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
skill and hard work and maybe one

53
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,640
percent the equipment you own

54
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
my actual hardware has barely changed

55
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,000
from the day i started you're looking at

56
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
my actual setup here

57
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
all you need is a microphone a computer

58
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,240
and some software

59
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
you don't need to invest thousands of

60
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,119
dollars into building your own studio

61
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,159
just keep it simple

62
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,520
when it comes to hardware what is

63
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
important is having a decent microphone

64
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,360
and that's because low quality audio is

65
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,040
the quickest way to drop a viewer on

66
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,600
youtube

67
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
if you have bad audio on a programming

68
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
tutorial your video is going to be

69
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,399
unwatchable even if the visuals are

70
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,320
awesome all you really need is a decent

71
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,399
usb condenser mic which you can get for

72
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,439
under 100 bucks

73
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,880
the only other hardware you need is a

74
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,200
computer i prefer windows however macs

75
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,399
are a good choice as well

76
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,920
it'll help to have some decent specs on

77
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,119
your machine because much of the

78
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,040
software we use for video editing is

79
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,159
resource intensive

80
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,079
you'll want at least 16 gigs of ram the

81
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,680
best cpu you can afford

82
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,758
and an nvidia graphics card is useful as

83
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,520
well it can take a really long time to

84
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
render out video files in hd or 4k

85
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
and a more powerful computer will just

86
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,959
help you get things done faster

87
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,640
it's also worth noting that i don't show

88
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
my face in my videos so if you do want

89
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
to show your face you'll have to talk to

90
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
a face youtuber to figure out how that

91
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
works you probably need a webcam and a

92
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
green screen and that kind of stuff

93
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,239
now let's switch gears by talking about

94
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
the software i use which is far more

95
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,519
important the single most important tool

96
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,040
i use is adobe premiere

97
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
i have a subscription to adobe creative

98
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
cloud which is 52

99
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
a month and it's well worth the expense

100
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
if you produce a lot of videos

101
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
i'll show you my workflow in premiere in

102
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
just a minute but essentially it's just

103
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,599
a tool that gives you a timeline where

104
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
you can combine multiple audio and video

105
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
clips together into a single package

106
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
now many of my videos contain shorter

107
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,720
more advanced animations

108
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
and for that i use a tool called adobe

109
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,480
after effects it has more advanced

110
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
animation tools and it's good for short

111
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,840
clips that you can then render out

112
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
and bring into adobe premiere to combine

113
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,760
into your final video

114
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,680
now when it comes to static graphics and

115
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,959
other images that you might see in my

116
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,519
videos

117
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,000
i tend to use figma most often figma is

118
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
free for individuals and you can access

119
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
all of your assets on the web as well

120
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,200
depending on the type of graphics you

121
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
produce figma might be a little too

122
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,599
limited for you

123
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,280
but if you have adobe creative cloud you

124
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,200
also have access to photoshop and

125
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,920
illustrator

126
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
which are also good options for static

127
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
graphics all this software takes time to

128
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,080
learn

129
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,920
but luckily there are a lot of pre-built

130
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
templates out there for you to make

131
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,599
professional videos with minimal effort

132
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,599
the primary hub that i use to access

133
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,440
graphics and pre-built templates

134
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
is video hive it contains a ton of after

135
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,440
effects and premiere templates that you

136
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
can use to quickly add titles

137
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,920
transitions and logo intros and all

138
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,440
kinds of stuff to your videos

139
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,519
for example you can find a fancy logo

140
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,280
intro swap out your logo

141
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
and now you have a professional logo

142
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,799
sting for 20 bucks and maybe an hour of

143
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,360
work

144
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,120
aside from templates you'll also likely

145
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,480
want stock photography

146
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,159
and other graphic assets to use in your

147
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
videos there are plenty of places where

148
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
you can buy stock photography but the

149
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,640
place i look first

150
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,519
is either unsplash or pexels these sites

151
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,120
have a huge collection of free images

152
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
and they're entirely free

153
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,080
another element that i use in many of my

154
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
videos are animated gifs

155
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
and i source those from giphy not all

156
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
gifs can be freely used in your videos

157
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,200
though so make sure to respect the

158
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
copyright of the artist that created it

159
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
and lastly i use a lot of icons and

160
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
emojis in my videos and i primarily get

161
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,240
those graphics from flatikon.com

162
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,919
i pay 10 bucks a month for this service

163
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,000
however they do have a free tier as well

164
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
okay so now that you know the tools i

165
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,199
use and where i get things i want to

166
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,400
talk about how i approach

167
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
content creation for programmers my

168
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,400
strategy has always been to distill

169
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,280
content down

170
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
to the most efficient possible form the

171
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
majority of programming tutorials out

172
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
there are very long anywhere from 20

173
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
minutes to 5 hours

174
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
content like that is generally great for

175
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
beginners but as an experienced

176
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
developer i have a very hard time

177
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
sitting through content that long

178
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
in most of my videos i make the

179
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,759
assumption that the audience is made up

180
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,440
primarily of intermediate level

181
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
developers

182
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
by making that assumption i can omit the

183
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
very basic stuff and get right into the

184
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
intermediate to advanced level stuff

185
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
that the audience will find

186
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
interesting the bottom line there is

187
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,000
know your audience and craft your

188
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
content around what you think the

189
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
audience wants

190
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,680
as your channel grows you'll learn that

191
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
you can't please all the people all the

192
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,440
time

193
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,840
[Music]

194
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,199
really try to learn from the negative

195
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
criticisms that you get from people on

196
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,440
youtube

197
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
most critics are people that actually

198
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
like you and want to watch your channel

199
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,800
grow

200
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,320
and some people out there will just be

201
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
mean for the sake of being mean but you

202
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,360
should never let that go to your heart

203
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,639
because a person who spends their

204
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
limited time here as an internet troll

205
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,000
is someone you should feel sorry for

206
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
more than anything now let's get down to

207
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
brass tacks and look at my actual

208
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
workflow for producing a video

209
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
now because i produce code tutorials the

210
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
first thing i do is write some code

211
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
i'm not going to get into the details of

212
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,160
that but let's just assume that i have a

213
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
full working project here that i want to

214
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
teach the audience about

215
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
i just wrote this code so i know exactly

216
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
how it works and the next thing i do

217
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,880
is open up adobe premiere to a template

218
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
that i have that has some of my reusable

219
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,840
assets in it

220
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,199
now a lot of people think that i write a

221
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
script for every video because they

222
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,680
sound scripted

223
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
but that's actually not the case what i

224
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
actually do is focus on the voiceover

225
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,039
first and i do that right here in

226
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,120
premiere by clicking the record icon

227
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
in the timeline i record the audio in a

228
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
bunch of small chunks

229
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
almost sentence by sentence when i have

230
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
the phrase i want to use i use the razer

231
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,800
tool

232
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,720
to cut that piece of audio and then put

233
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,479
it together with the rest of the dialog

234
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,560
i often record the entire dialog before

235
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,039
i add any visual assets to the video

236
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,560
as you can see here in the recording for

237
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
this very video that's exactly what i'm

238
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:26,960
doing

239
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
after i record all the audio clips i

240
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,160
nest them together

241
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
and then go into essential sound and set

242
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
them as the dialog

243
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
in this panel i automatch the loudness

244
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
which will give it a consistent

245
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
broadcast volume

246
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
and i also like to add a de-esser and

247
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
possibly a vocal enhancer to make the

248
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
sound of the voice a little more rich

249
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
now that that's done we need to fill up

250
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
our video with some visuals i'd

251
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
recommend spending the most time making

252
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,759
the visuals at the beginning of the

253
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,960
video really good

254
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
the first 60 seconds is your best

255
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,160
opportunity to set the tone for the

256
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
video and really inspire the viewer to

257
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
see it through until the end

258
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
the video's watch time or viewer

259
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,720
retention is really important for

260
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,080
getting that video promoted through

261
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
youtube's algorithm

262
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
try to keep long pauses to a minimum and

263
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
give your viewer a consistent feed of

264
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
useful information

265
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
when i present a graphic on the screen

266
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
it typically only stays there for one to

267
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,880
five seconds

268
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,240
at this point the graphics can really

269
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
emphasize what you've already said in

270
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
the dialog

271
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,319
after the initial intro we need to show

272
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,000
the actual code that we're working on

273
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,599
many tutorials will show the programmer

274
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,360
writing out the code line by line in

275
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
real time

276
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
this is very slow and also very error

277
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
prone it is more realistic

278
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
that way but that's not really what

279
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
we're going for here here's how i do it

280
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,639
when i have a code snippet that i'm

281
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,400
talking about i first delete it in

282
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,599
reverse order

283
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
after that i start my screen recorder

284
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,960
and then i hit ctrl z

285
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,599
or undo to record each snippet being

286
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,080
inserted

287
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,319
into the document one by one i can then

288
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,000
take that screen recording and just lay

289
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
it right on top of my audio track

290
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,360
now it is difficult to get the timing

291
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
perfectly right here so one useful

292
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,680
technique

293
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,759
is to add a frame hold to your actual

294
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,520
video which is kind of like taking a

295
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,240
screenshot

296
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,680
so you can hold that position while

297
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
you're talking about it and if it's not

298
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,919
100

299
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,280
clear what line of code you're talking

300
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
about i'd recommend throwing in an emoji

301
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
or some other graphic that explains what

302
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,000
that line of code is doing with text

303
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,599
that way if the user pauses the video

304
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,039
they can look at that line of code and

305
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,560
really understand what it's all about

306
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,919
now once you have all the pieces put

307
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,479
together

308
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,560
ideally take a long break or sleep on it

309
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
and come back to the video with a fresh

310
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,120
set of eyes tomorrow

311
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
then watch it critically as if you were

312
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,639
the end viewer do anything you can

313
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
to polish or improve the quality of the

314
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,840
video before rendering it to

315
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
upload to youtube once you're happy with

316
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,039
the quality your next important

317
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,840
consideration

318
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
is the title and the thumbnail a catchy

319
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
title and thumbnail will improve the

320
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
click-through rate and get your video

321
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,719
seen by more people on youtube

322
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,159
that's a whole nother topic that i might

323
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
break down in a future video if you want

324
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,279
to see it let me know in the comments

325
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,480
i'm going to go ahead and wrap things up

326
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
there i hope this video gave you some

327
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
insight into how i produce my own videos

328
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,519
but keep in mind that there's no one

329
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,880
right way to do things and you will

330
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
definitely find your own path when you

331
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
start putting in the work

332
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,959
make sure to subscribe to my personal

333
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640

334
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,760
like this in the future

thanks for watching and i will see you
