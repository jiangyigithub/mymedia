Structured Query Language (SQL), or SQL for short, is the gold standard language for communicating with relational database management systems. You've likely heard of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle, all of which are based on SQL with their own variations.

Initially developed in the early '70s to manipulate and retrieve data from IBM's System R database, by 1986, SQL was standardized into the syntax that remains extremely popular in technical applications today. A relational database organizes data into tables, similar to an Excel spreadsheet, where columns contain attributes or types of data, and each row represents an individual record or data point with its unique ID, known as a primary key.

Relationships between data points are established by taking the unique ID from one row and storing it on a different row in a different table in a special column known as a foreign key. For example, in the "teams" table, the team ID is the primary key, but in the "players" table, it's the foreign key, indicating that a player belongs to one team, while a team can have many players. This structuring minimizes duplication and redundancy.

The role of SQL is not only to read, create, update, and delete data but also to join data together based on the relationships embedded within it. The syntax comprises several key parts. At a high level, there's a statement or a piece of code that performs an action, such as reading or writing to the database. Within a statement, keywords manipulate the database. For example, the "SELECT" keyword is used to query for specific columns from a table, and the "WHERE" keyword filters results based on a specified condition.

SQL also allows for joining data from different tables using the "JOIN" keyword, connecting data based on matching primary and foreign keys. A full SQL statement is composed of a collection of clauses that together achieve a specific purpose.

The beauty of SQL is its universality; the code can be executed on numerous databases that support SQL. This has been a brief overview of Structured Query Language in 100 seconds. Like and subscribe if you want to see a full SQL tutorial. Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.
