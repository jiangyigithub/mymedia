Visual Studio Code, a free and open-source program for editing code, is essentially a tool for managing text files organized in a precise way. Developed by Microsoft, it first appeared in 2015 as a lightweight, cross-platform code editor that receives monthly updates. Today, it stands as the world's most popular code editor.

To get started, download Visual Studio Code and open a folder containing your application files. Enhance your coding experience by updating syntax and icon themes through the settings icon.

Visual Studio Code provides an integrated development environment to efficiently edit, analyze, and manage code files. The file explorer displays all files in the directory, and opening a file reveals syntax-highlighted text. The editor automatically detects issues in your code, such as unused variables, and provides visual cues like opacity and red squiggly lines.

The code structure is outlined for easy navigation, and as you start typing, VS Code's Intellisense feature suggests autocompletions. Professional developers leverage these suggestions to speed up coding. Right-clicking on your code offers various options for analysis and refactoring.

For faster navigation, use keyboard shortcuts or the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), which allows quick access to VS Code commands and project files. You can open a terminal session from the command palette, enabling you to run commands like `git init` for source control.

VS Code is minimal by design, but its functionality can be extended through extensions. The Extensions panel offers a variety of packages for specialized tooling related to different frameworks or languages.

Projects often involve cloud integration, and VS Code's Remote button allows connections to remote GitHub repositories, Docker containers, or cloud servers. It even supports running VS Code itself in the cloud for access from any browser.
