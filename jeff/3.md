C++ is a statically typed, compiled programming language known for its widespread use in software infrastructure and infamous for its steep learning curve. It was created in 1979 by Bjorn Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs. He was inspired by the object-oriented nature of Simula but needed a language with the high performance of C, leading to the birth of C++ with classes.

Designed as a superset of C, virtually any C program is also a valid C++ program. However, C++ adds zero-overhead abstractions, including object-oriented patterns like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. Today, C++ is utilized in various systems with constrained memory demands, such as the Unreal Engine for AAA video games, programs like Adobe After Effects, databases like MySQL and MongoDB, and embedded systems like the display on smart toasters. It is also extensively used to implement low-level infrastructure like language compilers and virtual machines.

C++ is popular because it combines low-level memory and hardware control with high-level abstractions like classes and smart pointers. This makes it harder to make mistakes that could lead to issues, but when mistakes occur, they can have significant consequences.

To get started with C++, install a C++ compiler like GCC or Clang. Then, create a file with a .cpp extension and include the iostream from the standard library for handling input and output. Code execution starts from the main function. To print "Hello, World," use standard character output followed by the bitwise shift left operator and a string literal. The std namespace can be omitted by adding a namespace declaration at the top of the file.

C++ supports object-oriented programming with classes. A class serves as a blueprint for an object, defining attributes and methods. Methods can be private or public, and it supports features like overloading, polymorphism, constructors, destructors, and inheritance.

To instantiate an object, type the class name followed by the object name and optional constructor parameters. Memory management in C++ can be done manually with pointers and references or using tools like unique pointers for safer and easier memory allocation.

To run the code, use a compiler like Clang++. This brief overview summarizes C++ in 100 seconds. If you enjoyed the content, hit the like button and subscribe for more short videos. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
